# MNIST Image Classification Using Neural Networks

## Objective
Develop a basic neural network model to classify images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Name**: MNIST Dataset
- **Description**: The MNIST dataset consists of handwritten digits (0-9) and is commonly used for training image processing systems.

## Steps

### 1. Data Preparation
- Loaded the MNIST dataset.
- Preprocessed the images by normalizing pixel values.

### 2. Model Building
- Designed a simple neural network using a sequential model.
- Added Dense layers with ReLU activation and a Softmax output layer.
- Compiled the model with a loss function and optimizer.

### 3. Model Training
- Trained the neural network on the training set with a suitable batch size and number of epochs.
- Monitored training progress by evaluating accuracy and loss on a validation set.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated the trained model on the test set to measure accuracy.
- Visualized model performance using a confusion matrix.

## Deliverables
- Python script or Jupyter Notebook containing code for data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
- Visualization of training/validation accuracy and loss curves.
- Model evaluation results.
